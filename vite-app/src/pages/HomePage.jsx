      <p><a href="https://dineroismoney.com" target="_blank">Dinero Protocol</a> is pushing the boundaries of decentralized money, and we're here because we dig that. They're doing some cool stuff over there.</p>
      <p>For some reason, their logo is an eyeball.</p>
      <p>Eyeballer is an NFT project, in honor of Dinero but not affiliated with it, that consists of 10k <em>unique</em> images of eyeballs. Unlike yours, these ones don't come in pairs.</p>
      <p>Show your Dinero appreciation, pluck one for yourself, be an Eyeballer.</p>
      <p>* I hope you get a picture you like! You should not really expect it to increase in value, or to get any airdrops. We're doing this for fun.</p>
